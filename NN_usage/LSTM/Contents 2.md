### Introduction 

* This is an Matlab source code folder for the usage of LSTM

* To test this code, you should install Neural Network Toolbox firstly.

* Run LSTM_preporcess.m to process the sound data into feature vectors and save them as a mat file.

* Run LSTM_test.m to Randomly choose the training set to learn the features we extracted and recognize the sounds in the rest data called testing set.
